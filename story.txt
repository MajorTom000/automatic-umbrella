On the way to school today, Winfred met the girl who appeared in his dream last night.

She was waiting at the bus stop. Winfred saw her while he has walking to his classes.
Just like in his dream she was listening to music and holding on to a large art project.
It was raining and she was trying to protect her painting from the rain. Winfred started to 
walk to her.
