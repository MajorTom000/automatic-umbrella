On the way to school today, Winfred met the girl who appeared in his dream last night.

She was waiting at the bus stop. Winfred saw her while he has walking to his classes.
Just like in his dream she was listening to music and holding on to a large art project.
It was raining and she was trying to protect her painting from the rain. Winfred started to 
walk to her.

Being the nice guy that he was, Winfred offered her his umbrella. She was extremely thankful, as her painting
was starting to become wet. Winfred smiled to himself as he felt the water soak through his shoes.

It was an amazing day for Winfred as he and the girl of his dreams spent the whole day together. They quickly fell
in love and later got married.
